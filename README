Genetic Algorithm Solution of the Knapsack Problem
==================================================

This program narrows into a solution to the knapsack problem in R. A description of the problem can be found online, and admittedly this program is a simple implementation of
it. The purpose of this program is to show how a genetic algorithm is set up and run in
R. If you wish to modify it for some other problem, you'll be modifying the fitness
function for your unique solution space (and whatever else you need to do), but the 
skeleton of the problem should remain the same.

In other words, the point of this program is to show you how to write a simple genetic
algorithm in R for a simple problem.
